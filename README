Allen Bradley PCCC protocol library and DF1 link layer service.


!!!WARNING!!!
=============
These programs are capable of modifying data within programmable logic
controllers, which can result in equipment damage, personal injury and/or
loss of life. I assume no responsibility for the use of these programs.



Requirements
============

	libxml2(for df1d only): http:\\www.xmlsoft.org
	doxygen(only for libpccc HTML API docs): http:\\www.doxygen.org


Installation
============

	make
	become root
	make install

This will install the libpccc shared library in /usr/local/lib and the df1d
executable in /usr/local/bin. The pccc.h header file will be installed in
/usr/local/include. These defaults can be changed by editing the Makefiles
as desired.

No configuration file is installed for df1d. Modify the example, df1d.cfg.xml,
and place it where you like.


Using libpccc
=============
Programs will need to #include <pccc.h> and add -lpccc when linking.



libpccc documentation
=====================
HTML documentation is available for the libpccc API.
It can be made as follows:

cd lib
make docs

Point your browser to index.html in the lib/docs directory.



Starting the DF1 link layer service
===================================
df1d <config file>

Running df1d without any configuration file specified will print out detailed
usage.
